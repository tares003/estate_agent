## Phase B0 — Foundation bootstrap (scaffold)

Status: **in progress**
PR: _(branch `chore/phase-b-foundation`, not yet opened)_
Branch: `chore/phase-b-foundation`
Tests added: 0 (bootstrap is config/scaffold; TDD begins with `packages/config` guards and the foundation packages)
Coverage Δ: n/a

### STEP 0 — discovery (done, targeted)

Read for the foundation: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` §9, master spec §P / §S.13 / §S.13a, `dev-briefs/sprint-01/_cross-cutting.md` (DoD + 8 shared packages + §J migration scope + CI guards G1–G11), `_tdd-protocol.md` (RED/GREEN, 10 test layers, coverage gates), `dev-todo-sprint-01.md` (sprint scope), EPIC-P/EPIC-S briefs, EPIC-H SMTP additions (FR-H-10a / H.12a). Broad per-epic + canvas-screen discovery deferred to the phase that consumes each brief.

### STEP 1 — stack confirmation (done)

Stack confirmed by the user and recorded authoritatively in `AGENTS.md` §9 / `CLAUDE.md` §9:
- **Architecture:** two-stack — Django + Wagtail (content) + Next.js (app), JSON API between them, unified session-cookie auth.
- **DB / tenancy:** PostgreSQL 16 + PostGIS, **shared DB + Row-Level Security** (`SET LOCAL app.current_tenant_id`).
- **Hosting:** pure self-hosted on Hetzner (Docker + Coolify/Dokku).
- **Storage:** local filesystem behind `StorageBackend`. **CDN:** Cloudflare free tier. **Email:** per-tenant SMTP (basic + OAuth) / configurable operator SMTP. **SMS:** Twilio. **Maps:** per-tenant Google or Mapbox. **Anti-spam:** Turnstile. **Billing:** Stripe. **Analytics + error-monitoring:** deferred from V1 (structured logging only). **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions. **Secrets:** SOPS + age.

### B0 work completed this phase

- Created branch `chore/phase-b-foundation`.
- **Normalised the design canvas path** — flattened accidental `design/design/canvas/` → `design/canvas/` (91 files, `git mv`) to match every brief + the prompt's STEP 0f reference. Updated `.design-canvas-url`.
- **Repaired truncations** introduced during the stack write-up (see audit-report rows D-001, D-003).
- Root tooling: `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `.nvmrc`, `.npmrc`, `package.json` (pnpm workspace), `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `tsconfig.base.json`, `.prettierrc.json`, `.prettierignore`.
- ADRs written (status **Proposed**): `0001-api-framework` (→ Django Ninja), `0002-smtp-credential-encryption` (→ first-party Fernet/MultiFernet), `0003-backup-target` (→ Hetzner Storage Box + restic, with geo-replica upgrade path).
- Workspace directory skeleton + per-package/service READMEs (see B0 continuation).

### Blockers / findings encountered

1. **AGENTS.md was truncated** mid-word at line 155 during the stack write-up — §9 incomplete. **Resolved:** reconstructed §9 by mirroring the complete `CLAUDE.md` §9 (tool-agnostic voice, RLS-correct). (audit-report D-001)
2. **CLAUDE.md internal contradiction** — per-surface table said EPIC-S = "Django-tenants (schema-per-tenant)" while every other section + the user's decision say shared-DB + RLS. **Resolved:** corrected to RLS in both files. (audit-report D-002)
3. **PRODUCT.md is truncated** at line 232 — the final sentence of §9a is cut off. PRODUCT.md is on the do-not-touch list (`AGENTS.md` §7), so this is **left for the owner to fix**. (audit-report D-003 — OPEN)
4. **Three open ADRs** (0001/0002/0003) recorded as Proposed; ADR-0001 must be ratified before Phase B2.

Token spend rough estimate: foundation discovery + stack repair + B0 bootstrap — moderate.
